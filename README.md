## Assessing Your User Interface and Git Learning

* The objective of this challenge is test your knowledge on all of the topics surrounding user interface and git you learned this week.

* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in [Answers.md](Answers.md)

* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have and the training kit content, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.



## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] Create a branch called `develop` on your local build
* [ ] Set your HEAD to your newly created `develop` branch
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

#### Pro tip: Commit every time you complete a task or feature!

## Task 2: Comprehension Questions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. You can exercise your Googling skills and use training kit.  Open up the [Answers.md](Answers.md) file and record your responses there.

1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

## Task 4: About page
[Review the provided design file for the about page](design-files/about.png). You have been provided the HTML wrapper, footer, and page content for the about page. Create the rest of the missing HTML and CSS to match the design file.
* [ ] Copy and paste your home page navigation and header into the about page
* [ ] Update the header image with the about page image
* [ ] Link the `Home` navigation item back to the `index.html` page.
* [ ] Build the rest of the about page layout to match the design

## Task 5: Merge & Pull Request
* [ ] Once you have completed tasks 1-4, push all your commits up to your `develop` branch.  
* [ ] Switch your HEAD to `master`
* [ ] Merge the `develop` branch into `master`
* [ ] Push all your updates up to master
* [ ] Create a pull request back to the original `fork`

**Congratulations, you completed the sprint challenge!**

## Stretch Goals
